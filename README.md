# Full Stack MERN Fitness Tracker Web Application
* Implemented an MVC application with asynchronous controllers to handle fitness JSON data in HTTP requests 
* Utilized React Context API and Hooks for real-time UI-database syncing without redundant fetches or props drilling
* Utilized JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to protect REST API endpoints and local storage to persist user sessions
* Implemented an authentication mechanism to share fitness data between the API and front-end via JWTs
* Utilized the bcrypt Node.js package to salt and hash passwords in async mode using a thread pool and the validator package to enforce password strength and safeguard user data in storage
* Constructed models using the Mongoose API and enforced document structure using schemas in MongoDB
* Containerized application using Docker for lightweight deployment, and employed layer caching for increased build process efficiency
* Streamlined API testing using test suites in Postman
